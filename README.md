This is the collection of exercises from the course Simulation Of Complex Systems (FIM770) at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. The course is a part of the Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) program.

Purpose:
This course provides an introduction to dynamical systems and the methods used to analyze them. The aim of the course is to, without too much mathematical rigorousness, provide an understanding of theoretical concepts and practical aspects arising in the description of dynamical systems. While dynamical systems are applied in a wide range of disciplines, including mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, electronics and economics, most examples in the course are based on simple physics problems.
